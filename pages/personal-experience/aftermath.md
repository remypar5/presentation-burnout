# Permanent Damage
(or maybe just long term)

<v-clicks>

- Overwhelmed
- Forgetful+
- Emotional
- Lonely
- Introverted even more
- Holding babies
</v-clicks>

<!--

- [click] (Overwhelmed)
  - I "plan" down-time
  - MTG with friends
  - Parties
- [click] (Forgetful+) Especially when tired
  - Ask my wife ;-)
  - Still "forget" if I actually said something
- [click] (Emotional) Movies/series, sadness, happiness, etc.
- [click] (Lonely) From time to time
- [click] (Introverted) Leave early at parties. Not going on week long vacation with In-Laws
- [click] (Babies) Used to love it. Now I don't really care for it

## Transition
"Luckily, not everything is just bad. In some ways I came out for the better"

# Positive "Damage"
Hopefully here to stay

<v-clicks>

- Mentally stronger
- Learned to say "No!"
- More open about myself
- No more presenter's anxiety!
</v-clicks>

<!--
- [click] Mentally stronger
  - More resilient
  - I can see it coming now
  - Consulting as a DS lead
- [click] Saying "No"
  - "See? I'm here, aren't I?"
- [click] More open
  - How I feel
  - Getting help for it
- [click] Presenter's anxiety
  - Realised in the past few days
  - I used to be anxious days before
  - Now I'm not at all anymore
  - Maybe: Burn-out anxiety dwarfs speaker's anxiety

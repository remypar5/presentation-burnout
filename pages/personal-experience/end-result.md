# Permanent Damage
Or maybe just long term

- Overwhelmed
- Forgetful+
- Emotional
- Lonely
- Introverted even more
- Holding babies

<!--

## Transition
"Not everything is just bad. I have become a better person in some ways"

-->

---

# Positive "Damage"
Hopefully here to stay

- Mentally stronger
- Learned to say "No!"
- More open about myself
- No more presenter's anxiety!

<!--
- Mentally stronger
  - More resilient
  - I can see it coming now
- Saying "No"
  - foo
- More open
  - How I feel
  - Getting help for it
- Presenter's anxiety
  - I used to be anxious days before
  - Now I'm not at all anymore

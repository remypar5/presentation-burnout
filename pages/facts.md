# Definition

<blockquote cite="https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/frequently-asked-questions/burn-out-an-occupational-phenomenon">

“Burn-out is a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. It is characterized by three dimensions:

- feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion;
- increased mental distance from one’s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job; and
- reduced professional efficacy.”

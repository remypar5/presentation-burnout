# Look for the Signs

Most people _don't see the signs_ them selves.

- More tasks being put onto you
- Structural overtime
- Not saying "no"
- Losing velocity
- Not finishing your work
- Always tired
- Signals from team/family/friends
- Not being able to sleep properly
- "I'm living on caffeine"
- Can't focus
